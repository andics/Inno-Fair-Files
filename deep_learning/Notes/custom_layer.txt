Add a custom feature extraction layer to the segmentation neural network.


Firstly, seperate the bone from the background using a simple curve fittning algorithm.
Within the bone, extract each 'bubble' made of black pixels using a hole filling algorithm. 
Whenever a position is filled from the algorithm, it is a bubble.

From all of those bubbles, only a few are parts of the suture. The others will
just be the inside texture of the bone. the question is; how do we find the bubbles
belonging to the suture.

For each bubble try to fit a circle around it. Create a map of circle crossings.
Record the XY values of the circle crossings which are in the provided  by the training set
suture region. Do this for all of the images provided in the database.
The result would be pattern detector which would pick on similarlly looking circle crossings on future images, 
and will bias the pixels in the coresponding circles. 

This idea expoloits the oval shaped nature of each bubble in the bone, and uses it to further limit the
possible positions at which the suture might be
