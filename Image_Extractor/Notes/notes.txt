RAW files contain information about amount of light exposure at each pixel, which is the most pure form of unprocessed data.
The use of such unprocessed data would require a special algorithm to generate a way in which to associate this information
with pixel color and so to produce a visually observable image.

Better to use already generated observable images in TIF formats.
